        <h1>Golden chicken</h1>

        <img src="../img/chicken.jpg" alt="beautiful golden chicken cooked to perfection">

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This chicken dish combines elements from three of my favorite chicken recipes: chicken curry, chicken tagine, and a Creole-style smothered chicken. The braising liquid is rich and delicious, getting its yellow golden color from turmeric and saffron and its intense flavor from a low-and-slow simmer. Serve over buttery mashed potatoes, rice, or noodles. Ladle the sauce over top, and garnish with sliced green onions and minced jalapeños.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (12 ounce) chicken leg quarters</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
            <li>½ cup diced jalapeño pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup diced jalapeño pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2½ cups cold water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon saffron threads, crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried currants</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon base</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken leg quarters on a work surface with the skin facing up. Make a cut into the thickest part of each drumstick, all the way down to the bone. Then make two cuts, about 1 inch apart, right in the center of each thigh. Season both sides generously with 2 teaspoons kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and sear until skin is nicely browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip and sear for 2 more minutes. Turn off the heat and remove chicken to a plate, leaving any rendered fat in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat back on to medium; add onion, celery, jalapeño, and a pinch of salt to the skillet. Sauté until onion turns translucent and veggies have softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, pepper, cayenne, cinnamon, and garlic; cook and stir until garlic has cooked a bit and spices are toasted, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste, vinegar, water, and saffron. Increase heat to high and stir in currants and chicken base; bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Add chicken to the skillet, skin-side up, and reduce heat to low. Baste chicken with the liquid. Cover and cook over low or medium-low heat at a gentle simmer for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Flip chicken, cover, and simmer gently until the meat is fork-tender and almost falling off the bone, about 30 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip and baste chicken again. Increase heat to medium and cook, uncovered, until chicken is very tender and the braising liquid has reduced a bit, 20 to 30 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Taste the braising liquid and adjust seasoning if needed before serving.</li>
        </ol>
